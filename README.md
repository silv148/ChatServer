# ðŸ–§ ChatServer (Linux)

A basic TCP-based chat application built in C++ using raw sockets. This project includes a server and client that communicate over a TCP connection on the same machine or across a network.

---
### ðŸ“Œ Notes
The server listens on port 1605 (defined in the source).

Type # to close the connection from either side.

Both client and server must be run on the same machine unless you change the IP address and port accordingly.
